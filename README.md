# Shelf
A comic database and collection management tool

##Search Planning:
* Search results should be based on two main factors: most significant series and most recent, as thouse are probably the most importnat to people.
* Below those two sections, all other results can display with advanced date filtering.  
*Â Need to also optimize for "talent" searches. For expample, if someone searches for Jack Kirby, his most significant and most recent results should 
show.  It would also be cool if we could display a picture of him... but that might be wishful thinking or a whole separate database.
